Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'elon musk' with 'mr burns'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/salpie/elon-musk-to-mr-burns/blob/master/ELONMUSK-to-MRBURNS.crx)

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above, and therefore it did not replace your cloudflare URLs with buttflare URLs. Thank you for your concern.
